# masterHelper
Master Helper CSS - a bunch of CSS classes for easier HTML/CSS modifications.

All classes come in 2 variations - a non-important and an important version.
Example: the "m-0" is a { margin: 0px }, but the "m-0-i" is the { margin: 0px !important }.

Feel free to request more classes at any time.
